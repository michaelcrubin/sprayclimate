## Code Overview

The provided code implements an analysis of agronomic spraying climate in Brazil. Here is a summary of the main components and functionalities:

1. **Data Collection**: The code collects historical climate data from 2 Weather stations in Brazil. It includes information on air temperature, relative humidity.

2. **Analysis**: The code performs analysis on the collected data, specifically focusing on DeltaT and Wetbuld Temperature values. DeltaT represents the difference between the current air temperature and the dew point temperature. These variables are crucial in determining optimal conditions for agronomic spraying.

3. **Visualization**: The code generates visualizations to effectively demonstrate the relationship between Temp, RH, and agronomic spraying efficiency. The visualizations include line plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps, providing clear and informative insights.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have R and RStudio installed on your machine.

2. Install the necessary packages. You can use the following command in the R console:
  install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "ggmap"))

3. Copy the provided code into a file named `agronomic_spraying.Rmd` or any other preferred filename.

4. Open the RStudio application and open the copied file.

5. Install any additional packages prompted by RStudio by running the respective commands in the R console.

6. Run the code chunk by chunk to perform data collection, analysis, and visualization.

## Usage

Once the code is running, you can use the following steps to navigate through the analysis:

1. Set the desired parameters for data collection, such as location and time range.

2. Run the code chunk to collect the historical climate data.

3. Set the parameters for the analysis, such as thresholds for DeltaT.

4. Run the code chunk to perform the analysis and generate the visualizations.

5. Interpret the results and draw insights from the visualizations.

6. Modify the parameters and rerun the analysis to explore different scenarios.

## Conclusion

By examining the agronomic spraying climate in Brazil through the lens of air temperature and relative humidity, this project aims to enhance knowledge and awareness regarding optimal conditions for effective spraying practices. The combination of data collection, analysis, and visualization provides valuable insights for agronomists, researchers, and anyone interested in the field of agriculture.
